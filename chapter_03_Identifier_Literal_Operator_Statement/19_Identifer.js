let myVariable = 10;
// This is a valid identifier and can be used to store the value 10.

// they look like keywords but they are not reserved keywords, so they can be used as identifiers.
//  However, it is generally not recommended to use them as identifiers to avoid confusion and maintain code readability.

let undefined = 5; // Works but never do this
let infinity = 10; // Works but never do this
//While these identifiers are technically valid, it is strongly discouraged to use them as they can lead to confusion and make your code harder to read and maintain. It is best practice to avoid using reserved keywords or commonly used global variables as identifiers in your code. */
